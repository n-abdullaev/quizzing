2) Quiz Data (local JSON)
2.1 Create your data folder & files

 Create folder: src/quizzes/

 Create file: src/quizzes/history-kg.json

 (Optional) Create src/quizzes/general-science-01.json for a second quiz

2.2 Define a consistent schema

 Decide your schema fields: id, question, options[4], answerIndex, explanation?

 Ensure exactly 20 questions

 Check each answerIndex is 0–3

 Avoid duplicate options unless intentional

 Keep questions short (1–2 lines max), explanations 1–2 sentences

2.3 Content QA pass

 Balance difficulty (easy → medium → a few hard)

 Mix question types (recall, concept, timeline)

 Spell/grammar check

 Make options similar in length to reduce bias

 Save and commit (version control)

3) Pages / Flow
3.1 Home page (MVP)

 Title (app name + short tagline)

 Big Start Quiz button (center)

 Subtitle: “20 questions • 20 minutes”

 Confirm Home shows on app start

3.2 Loading state

 Add a very simple Loading… state while quiz data loads

 Add an error state with “Retry” if loading fails

3.3 Quiz screen structure

 Top sticky bar: thin countdown bar (global 20 min)

 Meta row: “Q x/20 • mm:ss remaining”

 Question card: large, readable text

 Options: four large, tappable buttons

 Ensure the layout is mobile-friendly (big touch targets)

3.4 Results screen

 Score summary: X/20 and percent

 Short line: “Great job!” / “You can do better—try again!”

 Button: Retake Quiz

 Review list: for each question show:

 Question

 Your answer (mark wrong in red)

 Optional explanation

4) Core Features
4.1 Timer (global 20 minutes)

 Start timer when first question appears

 Show mm:ss in meta row

 On timeout → auto-submit: answered kept, blanks counted as 0

4.2 Navigation & state

 Current index: start at Q1

 Previous/Next move between questions

 Optional: Disable Next until an option is chosen

 Keep selection editable until submit

 Remember the current index on refresh (local persistence later)

4.3 Answer selection

 Single-select (one option at a time)

 Clear selected visual (border/filled)

 No “correct/incorrect” feedback until after submit

4.4 Scoring & submit

 On submit: compute +1 per correct, 0 per wrong/blank

 Show total score + percentage

 If unanswered exist, show confirm prompt:
“You left N unanswered. Submit anyway?”

4.5 Retake

 Reset timer

 Reshuffle options (if enabled)

 Return to Q1

4.6 Local persistence (refresh safety)

5) Polish (small wins that matter)
5.1 Option shuffling

 Shuffle options once on quiz load

 Keep the mapping stable for the duration of the attempt

5.2 Timer color states

 Default color (neutral)

 Switch to amber at <= 5:00

 Switch to red at <= 1:00

5.3 Accessibility & keyboard

 Keyboard: 1–4 selects options

 Keyboard: Enter for Next/Submit

 Focus states visible (don’t rely only on color)

 Sufficient contrast for text and selected states

5.4 Microcopy & feedback

 Consistent labels (“Previous”, “Next”, “Submit”, “Retake”)

 Empty states (if data fails): “Couldn’t load quiz. Retry.”

 Confirmation text for submit with blanks

5.5 Mobile checks

 Sticky top bar stays visible while scrolling

 Buttons are at least 44px height

 No horizontal scrolling

 Debounce clicks to prevent double-submit

6) Manual Test Checklist (acceptance tests)
6.1 Full pass

 Start quiz → answer all → submit → correct score and review appear

6.2 Unanswered flow

 Leave 2–3 blanks → submit → see warning or allowed submit → score reflects blanks

6.3 Refresh safety

 Reach Q7 with some answers → refresh → come back at Q7 with answers + time intact

6.4 Timeout behavior

 Let timer hit 0:00 → auto-submit → see score & review

6.5 Retake behavior

 Press Retake → timer resets, selections cleared, options reshuffle

6.6 Navigation & keyboard

 Previous/Next work at edges (Q1/Q20) as expected

 Keyboard shortcuts work (1–4, arrows, Enter)

6.7 Mobile UX

 Test on a phone-sized window (or real device) → all buttons easy to tap, layout stable

7) (Optional) Multi-quiz ready

 Add a small quiz list on Home (title, 20Q badge)

 Selecting an item loads that quiz JSON

 Keep the rest of the flow identical

Pro tips while you work

Keep a “Bugs & Tweaks” note: log tiny issues as you notice them; fix in batches.

Timebox features: if a polish task takes >30 min now, defer it to after MVP.

Commit often with meaningful messages (“feat: add results screen summary”, etc.).
